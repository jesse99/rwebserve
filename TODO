REST in Practice
RESTful Web Services
RESTful Web Services Cookbook

* Work on http support:
	- 4.3 has rules for when to include a body
	- 5.11 has methods
	- request url can be *
	- urls can be encoded
	- support custom methods
* Do modules within a lib have access to un-exported items within other modules?
	- if so file a bug suggesting clarification
	- if not file a bug
* Look at stuff on ipod.
* Add support for uri template matching:
	- change home so that it links to /hello/joe%20bob
	- if template ends with a slash uri doesn't have to
	- handle *trailing syntax
	- test a wacky method
* Make sure gnos still works (especially css files):
	- should error out with missing not-supported.html file
	- set debug
* Add default css handler.
* Add support for other http methods besides GET.
* Make sure examples are well commented.
* Look at some python or haskell web servers.
* Look at:
	- hal, rest-style json: http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html
* Work on restbucks example.
* Talk about architecture.
* Servers need to handle Connection: close in requests

* Allow for multiple roots.

REST		http://kellabyte.com/2011/09/04/clarifying-rest/    http://codebetter.com/glennblock/2011/05/09/hypermedia-and-forms/
1) Each request from the client to the server must contain all of the data that is necessary to handle the request
2) The data within a response to a request must be implicitly or explicitly labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable
3) Each layer cannot see beyond the immediate layer with which it is communicating with
4) Uniform interface
4a) Each resource has a URI and is access through a defined set of HTTP methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
4b) Each resource can have one or more representations. Such as application/xml, application/json, text/html, etc
4c) Self-descriptive messages: Requests and responses contain not only data but additional headers describing how the content should be handled
4d) Hypermedia as the engine for application state

A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious coupling
of client and server). Servers must have the freedom to control their own namespace. 
Instead, allow servers to instruct clients on how to construct appropriate URIs, such 
as is done in HTML forms and URI templates, by defining those instructions within 
media types and link relations. [Failure here implies that clients are assuming a 
resource structure due to out-of band information, such as a domain-specific 
standard, which is the data-oriented equivalent to RPC's functional coupling].
