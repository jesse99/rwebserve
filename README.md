rwebserve is a general purpose HTTP 1.1 web server written in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/).

It depends upon:
* The [rust-socket](https://github.com/jdm/rust-socket) library.
* The [rust-mustache](https://github.com/erickt/rust-mustache) template library.
* The [rparse](https://github.com/jesse99/rparse) parser combinator library.

The src directory contain the source code for the REST library.
The server directory contains a simple server written using the library.
